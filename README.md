 Espionage.Engine
</h1>

Espionage.Engine is a Unity game base / framework, where you design games off it (duh). 
Its meant to be a similar workflow to Unreal Engine / s&box where you can do a majority of the work for your game straight in code.
This means you should really only be using the editor for asset management, (Maps, Models, etc, setting up Blueprints). This allows
you to do a lotta cool stuff without having to have a spaghetti tree of Unity Scene References.
